Daily Task Manager

## Description
A simply designed task manager application that allows a user to input and save tasks or appointments for every hour of their business day. For user-friendly readability, the present time displays red, while all future ahead are shown in green, and any hour blocks that have past, are subtly taken out of the user's focus using a grey background.
